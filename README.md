 Key Elements of Wireframing:
   the key elements are: Layout Structure, Navigation, Content Placement, Functionality.
   Here’s a clear explanation of the **key elements found in a wireframe** — including **Layout Structure**, **Navigation**, **Content Placement**, and **Functionality** — along with examples of how each contributes to the overall design:

1. Layout Structure: Layout structure refers to the **overall visual framework** of the page — how elements like headers, footers, sidebars, and content sections are arranged on the screen.

**Example:**
A layout with a **top header**, a **left sidebar**, and a **main content area** helps users know where to look for navigation, tools, or content on every page.

 2.Navigation: Navigation represents the **menu items**, **links**, **tabs**, or **buttons** that help users move between different parts of the application or website.

**Example:**
A navigation bar at the top with links like **Home**, **Bookings**, **Profile**, and **Logout** allows users to move seamlessly between different parts of a Booking Management System.


 3.Content Placement**

**Definition: Content placement deals with **where specific content** (like text, images, forms, or tables) is displayed on the screen.

**Example:**
In a hotel booking wireframe, placing the **room options** in the center, with **filters on the left** and **booking summary on the right**, helps users compare and choose effectively.


 4. Functionality : Functionality in a wireframe shows the **interactive features** — what users can do, such as clicking a button, submitting a form, or filtering results.

**Example:**
A wireframe might include a **“Book Now” button** with an arrow or annotation indicating that it submits user input and redirects to the payment page.
