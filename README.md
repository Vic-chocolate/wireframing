 Key Elements of Wireframing:
   the key elements are: Layout Structure, Navigation, Content Placement, Functionality.
   Here’s a clear explanation of the **key elements found in a wireframe** — including **Layout Structure**, **Navigation**, **Content Placement**, and **Functionality** — along with examples of how each contributes to the overall design:

1. Layout Structure: Layout structure refers to the **overall visual framework** of the page — how elements like headers, footers, sidebars, and content sections are arranged on the screen.

**Example:**
A layout with a **top header**, a **left sidebar**, and a **main content area** helps users know where to look for navigation, tools, or content on every page.

 2.Navigation: Navigation represents the **menu items**, **links**, **tabs**, or **buttons** that help users move between different parts of the application or website.

**Example:**
A navigation bar at the top with links like **Home**, **Bookings**, **Profile**, and **Logout** allows users to move seamlessly between different parts of a Booking Management System.


 3.Content Placement**

**Definition: Content placement deals with **where specific content** (like text, images, forms, or tables) is displayed on the screen.

**Example:**
In a hotel booking wireframe, placing the **room options** in the center, with **filters on the left** and **booking summary on the right**, helps users compare and choose effectively.


 4. Functionality : Functionality in a wireframe shows the **interactive features** — what users can do, such as clicking a button, submitting a form, or filtering results.

**Example:**
A wireframe might include a **“Book Now” button** with an arrow or annotation indicating that it submits user input and redirects to the payment page.



Types of Wireframes: 
Low-fidelity (lo-fi) wireframes are simple, rough sketches or basic digital layouts that focus on structure and layout rather than design detail.
High-fidelity (hi-fi) wireframes are detailed, polished mockups that closely resemble the final product in terms of design and functionality.
Usage----- Use low-fidelity wireframes to explore ideas quickly and define structure.
Use high-fidelity wireframes when you need to test, refine, and present a near-final version of the interface.

Wireframes Used:
The wireframes shown in the image are high-fidelity wireframes, which are typically used in the later stages of the design process. These wireframes closely resemble the final product in both appearance and functionality.From the image, we can see that the design includes realistic user interface elements such as styled buttons, navigation bars, cards, and icons. The screens also use actual images, branded colors, and refined typography, all of which contribute to a polished and professional look. This level of detail indicates that the wireframes are meant to simulate the final user experience as closely as possible.Each screen represents a specific stage in the user journey, from the splash and login screens to the home page, property details, and reservation checkout process. The inclusion of these interactive and content-rich elements suggests that the wireframes are not just for layout purposes but are meant to demonstrate how users will navigate and interact with the system.
Overall, these high-fidelity wireframes are designed to be presented to stakeholders, used in usability testing, and handed off to developers as a visual guide. They serve as a nearly complete visual representation of the final product.
